This is a game of Clue between three (compuer) players in which a player learns
the secret cards merely by observing that another player passes at the end of
their turn. This answers a question of van Ditmarsch, "The description of game
actions in Cluedo." Agents are unsure of cards which appear in parentheses;
cards in all caps are known.


Secret cards: cdstick, library, MrsPeacock
P1 cards: study, MissScarlett, MsWhite, ballroom, kitchen, lounge
P2 cards: knife, revolver, dining, rope, ColMustard, ProfPlum
P3 cards: pipe, hall, billiard, conservatory, MrGreen, wrench
